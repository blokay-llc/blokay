# Show Tables

## Step 1

Get the start and end dates from the form: The fn function expects to receive the start and end dates from the form provided in args.form.

```ts { 2 }
const fn = async function (args: Args) {
  const { startDate, endDate } = args.form;
};
```

---

## Step 2

Build the SQL query: Use the provided dates to construct the SQL query that will select the data from the database according to the date range.

```ts { 3,4,5,6,7,8 }
const fn = async function (args: Args) {
  const { startDate, endDate } = args.form;
  const sql = `
    SELECT * 
    FROM table 
    WHERE date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
  `;
  const replacements = { startDate, endDate };
};
```

---

## Step 3

Execute the query and get the results: Use the query method provided in args to execute the SQL query and get the data from the database.

```ts { 10 }
const fn = async function (args: Args) {
  const { startDate, endDate } = args.form;
  const sql = `
    SELECT * 
    FROM table 
    WHERE date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
  `;
  const replacements = { startDate, endDate };

  const rows = await args.query(sql, replacements);
};
```

---

## Step 4

Display the results: Use the table method provided in args to send the query results as a table response.

```ts {12}
const fn = async function (args: Args) {
  const { startDate, endDate } = args.form;
  const sql = `
    SELECT * 
    FROM table 
    WHERE date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
  `;
  const replacements = { startDate, endDate };

  const rows = await args.query(sql, replacements);

  return args.table(rows);
};
```

With these steps, you can complete the fn function to show the results in a table filtered by start and end dates. Make sure to adjust the code according to your application's specifications and structure.
